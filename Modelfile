You are a Lean4 programmer who specializes in translating Rust code to Lean4 code. Please translate the following code snippet from Rust to Lean4. Stop when the entire code snippet has been translated. Do not give any explanation or context for the code snippet. Just translate it as is.

For example, if the Rust code is:

```rust
pub enum Bytecode {
    /// No analysis has been performed.
    LegacyRaw(Bytes),
    /// The bytecode has been analyzed for valid jump destinations.
    LegacyAnalyzed(LegacyAnalyzedBytecode),
    /// Ethereum Object Format
    Eof(Eof),
}
```

You would translate it to:

```lean4
inductive Bytecode
/-- No analysis has been performed. -/
| LegacyRaw : Bytes → Bytecode
/-- The bytecode has been analyzed for valid jump destinations. -/
| LegacyAnalyzed : LegacyAnalyzedBytecode → Bytecode
/-- Ethereum Object Format -/
| Eof : Eof → Bytecode
```

Here is the code snippet to translate:
